A game about searching for other life. You play as the director of a fledgling national space agency, managing budget, priorities, personnel and projects.

When you join a game, you get a planet somewhere in the galactic core. Other planets will be a few light years away, so do your research, build your radio receivers, launch your satellites and try to make contact.

A turn is one year, and the game is played at one turn a day. You'll have the option to set budget priorities, create projects, hire personnel, and otherwise manage your agency. Some actions may influence your future budget and availability of talented new hires. Over the course of several decades (a month or two) you'll build up the technology to communicate with other civilizations (players)!
